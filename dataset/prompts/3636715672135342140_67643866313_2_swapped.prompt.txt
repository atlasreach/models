Professional portrait shot with medium format camera, likely 85mm lens at f/2.8. Soft natural window lighting from left creates gentle highlights. White curtains diffuse light beautifully. Low camera angle, subject positioned on floor. Creamy skin tones, subtle vignetting, slight desaturation in post. Shallow depth of field with fabric background beautifully blurred.
